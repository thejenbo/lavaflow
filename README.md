# Lavaflow

## A notes app built with React, Redux, Express, and Firebase

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This app is a WIP started on August 8th, 2018. Track my progress as I string together all of the skills I've gained over the years by creating a product I would want to use every day! 

### To run this app:
1. Clone the repo
2. run `yarn`
3. `yarn start`
